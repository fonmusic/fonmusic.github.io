  <h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>
    I am a developer with a focus on backend, web and game development. I have experience working on various projects, 
    including web application development using .NET and Angular, game development using Unity, and development of class libraries. 
    I have the ability to develop structured, modular, and efficient code, following OOP principles and best practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am committed to continuous learning and improving my skills. I am quick to learn and adapt to new technologies 
    and programming languages. I also have a keen interest in exploring new software and technologies. I have a broad range 
    of interests beyond programming, and I believe that the best solutions and innovations arise at the intersection 
    of different fields. In my hobbies, I deeply study architecture and history. I also have extensive experience in music, including both creation and rights management.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am seeking an opportunity to apply my knowledge and experience in exciting projects, working with a team of 
    dedicated professionals. I would be glad to contribute and help achieve success in software development.
